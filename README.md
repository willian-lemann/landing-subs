 #### Get started

 You can start the project by doing `yarn dev` remember if you'll be using environment variables try to change  `yarn dev` script in your package.json to run `vercel dev` so you can use the vercel development environment; this way you can set all the environment variables in vercel

 - If you wanna use with `.env` files, it can be done too, you only have to change the name of the file to `.env.local`
